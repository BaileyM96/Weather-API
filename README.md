# Weather-API

## Description 

My objective was to create a weather API application that would be able to fetch current weather for any searched city and store that city into local storage so
I can retrieve it by clicking on it. The application also would display the 5 day forecast along with the UV index. 

## Technology Used

I used bootstrap, jquery, moment.js, JavaScript, CSS, and the open weather API
